# Title

MYSQL CORPORATE TRACKER

## Description

Use Inquirer package to present a series of questions to a user via a CLI.  The answers would subsequently integrate with MYSQL commands that would enable the user to view and change various aspects of an employee's information through a series of 3 interrelated tables.

The following image illustrates the expected output ![expected table display](assets/images/screen-shot-of-expected-output.png).

Output is based on the acceptance criteria outlined in the Module 12 Assignment Overview [Module-12-assignment](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1181/assignments/23358?module_item_id=464333).

## Installation

To initiate the series of questions, if my coding were correct, typing in node index.js would bring up the first question asking the user to select an option which would subsequently guide the user through the rest of the program.  MYSQL is initiated by typing in "mysql -u root -p" and then entering a mysql password to bring up the mysql prompt.

## Usage

From the three database tables that are created, Department, Role and Employee, a user can view all departments in a database as well as which employees work in specific departments, their names, titles, salaries and managers.  Additional departments and/or roles and/or employees can be added, updated or deleted, with the "SELECT * FROM tablename mysql command allowing the user to see the results of whatever option was selected in the updated table (or even just the specific row - I prefer to show the full table as it provides a broader perspective).

## Contributing

There is still work to be done, as I need to finish the coding to actually pass the responses from the prompts into the commands for the mysql actions. I also need to to fix whatever error is ending inquirer before allowing a user to enter any information.   Any feedback or assistance is always welcome.

## Testing

None at this time.

## Credits

Some assistance was provided in my weekly tutoring session, although we got stuck on the error noted above.  Additional assistance from the TA's during office hours and a number of visits to the Stack Overflow website [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).
